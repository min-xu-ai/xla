# Performance Caveats

PyTorch/XLA behaves semantically like regular PyTorch and XLA tensors share the full tensor interface with CPU & GPU tensors.
However, constraints in XLA/hardware and the lazy evaluation model suggest certain patterns might result in bad performance:

1.  **XLA/TPU yield degraded performance with too many recompilations.**

    XLA compilation is expensive. PyTorch/XLA automatically recompiles the graph every time new shapes are encountered.
    Usually models should stabilize within a few steps and you can see huge speedup for the rest of training.

    In order to avoid recompilations, not only shapes must be constant, but also computations accross XLA devices in all hosts.

    _Possible sources_:
    * Direct or indirect uses of `nonzero` introduce dynamic shapes; for example, masked indexing `base[index]` where `index` is a mask tensor.
    * Loops with a different number of iterations between steps can result in different execution graphs thus require recompilations.

    _Solution_:
    * Tensor shapes should be the same between iterations, or a low number of shape variations should be used.
    * Pad tensors to fixed sizes when possible.

1.  **Certain operations don't have native translations to XLA.**

    For these operations PyTorch/XLA automatically transfer to the CPU memory, evaluate on CPU, and transfer the result back to XLA device.
    Doing too many such operations during the training step can lead to significant slowdowns.

    _Possible sources_:

    - The `item()` operation explicitly asks for evaluating the result. Don't use it unless it's necessary.

    _Solution_:

    - For most ops we can lower them to XLA to fix it. Checkout [metrics report section](#metrics-report) to find out the missing ops and open a feature request on github.
    - Even when a PyTorch tensor is known as a scalar, avoid using `tensor.item()`. Keep it as a tensor and use tensor operations on it.
    - Use `torch.where` to substitute control flow when applicable.
      E.g. The control flow with `item()` used in [clip_grad_norm_](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/de19eeee99a2a282fc441f637b23d8e50c75ecd1/torch/nn/utils/clip_grad.py#L33) can be simply replaced by `torch.where` with dramatical performance improvement.
      ```python
      ...
      else:
        device = parameters[0].device
        total_norm = torch.zeros([], device=device if parameters else None)
        for p in parameters:
          param_norm = p.grad.data.norm(norm_type) ** norm_type
          total_norm.add_(param_norm)
        total_norm = (total_norm ** (1. / norm_type))
      clip_coef = torch.tensor(max_norm, device=device) / (total_norm + 1e-6)
      for p in parameters:
        p.grad.data.mul_(torch.where(clip_coef < 1, clip_coef, torch.tensor(1., device=device)))
      ```

1. **Iterators in `torch_xla.distributed.data_parallel` may drop the last few batches in the input iterator.**

   This is to make sure we do the same amount of work on all XLA devices.

   _Solution_:

   * When dataset is small, and there are too few steps, this may result in a no-op epoch. Therefore, it is better to use
   small batch sizes in those cases.

# Debugging

Sometimes bad things happen and a deeper look into the _PyTorch/TPU_ stack is necessary.
In order to do that, _PyTorch/TPU_ has a series of environment variables and function calls
which can help understading its internal behavior.

Note that the infromation in this section is subject to be removed in future releases of
the _PyTorch/TPU_ software, since many of them are peculiar to a given internal implementation
which might change.

## Metrics Report

The _PyTorch/TPU_ stack keeps a series of metrics and counters during its execution, and
the following API returns a string representation of them:

```Python
torch_xla._XLAC._xla_metrics_report()
```

Printing out that information can help during the debug phases and while reporting issues.

The information included within the metrics report include things like
- how many time we issue _XLA_ compilations and time spent on issuing.
- how many times we execute and time spent on execution
- how many device data handles we create/destroy etc...

These information is reported in terms of percentiles of the samples.
An example is:

```
Metric: CompileTime
  TotalSamples: 202
  Counter: 06m09s401ms746.001us
  ValueRate: 778ms572.062us / second
  Rate: 0.425201 / second
  Percentiles: 1%=001ms32.778us; 5%=001ms61.283us; 10%=001ms79.236us; 20%=001ms110.973us; 50%=001ms228.773us; 80%=001ms339.183us; 90%=001ms434.305us; 95%=002ms921.063us; 99%=21s102ms853.173us
```

The _PyTorch/TPU_ stack also has counters, which are named integer variables tracks
internal software status.
Example:

```
Counter: CachedSyncTensors
  Value: 395
```

In this report, any counter that starts with `aten::`
indicates a context switch between the XLA device and CPU, which can be a
potential performance optimization area in the model code.

Counters are useful to understand which operations the _PyTorch/TPU_ stack is routing
back to the CPU engine of _PyTorch_.
Things which looks like a _C++_ namespace are part of this category:

```
Counter: aten::nonzero
  Value: 33
```

If you see `aten::` ops other than `nonzero` and `_local_scalar_dense`, that usually means a missing
lowering in PyTorch/XLA, feel free to open a feature request for it on github issues.

## Environment Variables

There are also a number of environment variables which control the behavior of the _PyTorch/TPU_
software stack.

Setting such variables will cause different degrees of performance degradation, so they should
only be enabled for debugging.

* ```XLA_IR_DEBUG```: Enables the _Python_ stack trace to be catpured where creating IR nodes,
  hence allowing to understand which _PyTorch_ operation was responsible of generating such IR.

* ```XLA_HLO_DEBUG```: Enables the _Python_ stack frame captured when _XLA_IR_DEBUG_ is active,
  to be propagated to the _XLA_ _HLO_ metadata.

* ```XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FILE```: The path to a file which will be used to dump the IR graphs during
  execution. Note that the file can become really big if the option is left enabled and the
  _PyTorch_ program let run for long time. The graphs are appended to the file, so to have a clean
  sheet from run to run, the file should be explicitly removed.

* ```XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FMT```: The format of the graphs stored within the _XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FILE_
  file. Can be ```text``` (the default), ```dot``` (the _Graphviz_ format) or ```hlo```.

* ```XLA_METRICS_FILE```: If set, the path to a local file where the internal metrics will be
  saved at every step. Metrics will be appended to the file, if already existing.

* ```GET_TENSORS_OPBYOP```: Enables pure _OpByOp_ dispatch. The _PyTorch/TPU_ software tries to
  fuse together many _PyTorch_ operations into a single computation graph, but sometimes, either
  for debugging, or in case the _PyTorch_ code have a very dynamic nature (in shapes or graph
  terms), it is better to force the execution in _OpByOp_ mode (every IR node is lowered into
  a separate _XLA_ computation, and chain-executed). This environment variable, if set to 1,
  enables _OpByOp_ during the "get tensors" operation (the operation used by _PyTorch/TPU_ to
  fetch intermediate values back from the _TPU_ device into _PyTorch_ CPU tensors).

* ```SYNC_TENSORS_OPBYOP```: The same as _GET_TENSORS_OPBYOP_ but for "sync tensors" operation
  (the operation used at the end of a step, to flush pending IR computations and materialize
  them into _TPU_ device data).

* ```XLA_SYNC_WAIT```: Forces the XLA tensor sync operation to wait for its completion, before
  moving to the next step.

* ```XLA_USE_BF16```: If set to 1, tranforms all the _PyTorch_ _Float_ values into _BiFloat16_
  when sending to the _TPU_ device.

* ```XLA_USE_32BIT_LONG```: If set to 1, maps _PyTorch_ _Long_ types to _XLA_ 32bit type.
  On the versions of the TPU HW at the time of writing, 64bit integer computations are
  expensive, so setting this flag might help. It should be verified by the user that truncating
  to 32bit values is a valid operation according to the use of _PyTorch_ _Long_ values in it.

## Retrieving Stack Traces

In the event that the _PyTorch_ process is hanging, it might be useful to include the stack
traces together with the _Github_ issue.

First thing is to find out which PID the _PyTorch_ process is associated with. Using the ```ps```
command it is possible to find that information. It will be a _python_ process running your
main _python_ file.

In order to allow _GDB_ to attach a user process the following command should be run as root:

```Shell
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
```

The above command remains active until the machine is rebooted.

The, given the PID, it is possible to grab the stack traces with the following command:

```Shell
./scripts/dump_stacks.py PID > /tmp/stack-traces.log
```
